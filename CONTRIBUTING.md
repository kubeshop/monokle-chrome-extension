## Development

1. Go to chrome://extensions/
2. Toggle "Developer mode"
3. Select "Load unpacked"
4. Select the "extension" directory of this repository.
5. Open a repository in GitHub and you should now see the extension in action.
6. Editing code should automatically be updated.

note: The popup you'll have to open and close to see changes and I haven't
found a good way to see it within DevTools inspector.
